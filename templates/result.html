      <h3> Result </h3>  

      <p>GitHub API returned {{ result['entry_received']}} entries</p>
      <p>We removed {{ result['entry_parged'] }} entries because
         those PR took very short amount of time from opening the issue to
         merging the code.
        (the cutoff is less than 15 minutes, so the code change are
         likely to be notsubstantial)</p>

     <p> The remaining {{ result['entry_used'] }} entries were used 
         in crunching data </p>
     <p> Our research suggests that, on average, "{{ result['feature'] }}"
         took {{ result['average_time'] }} {{ result['time_unit'] }}(s) 
         to finish.
